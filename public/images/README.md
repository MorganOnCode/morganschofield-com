# Profile Picture Instructions

To complete the setup of your personal website, please add your profile picture to this directory with the following specifications:

1. Save your profile picture as `morgan-pfp-cropped.webp` in this directory
2. For best results, use a square image (1:1 aspect ratio)
3. Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger
4. The image will be displayed in a circular crop on the website

File path: `/Users/morgan/CursorCode/MORGAN-WEBSITE-v0.3/morganschofield.com/public/images/morgan-pfp-cropped.webp`

If you don't have a WebP image, you can convert your existing image to WebP format using various online tools or applications like Photoshop, GIMP, or online converters.
